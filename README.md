** Fastify Application with Socket Server Integration **

This is a backend project that demonstrates the implementation of a Fastify application with CRUD operations endpoints and a socket server for bidirectional communication. 

The project utilizes Fastify as the web framework and the WebSocket library for socket server integration.

* Prerequisites:
 Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:
 Node.js v20.11.1
 npm

* To start the Fastify application, run the following command:
  npm run dev
  
* Swagger Documentation:
  The Swagger documentation for the Fastify endpoints can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/documentation

* Socket Server:
  The socket server is integrated using the WebSocket library. The server listens for incoming messages from clients.
  To test the socket server, you can use a tool like Postman.
